# 🧵 HandsMen Threads: Streamlining Fashion Operations with Salesforce

## 📌 Project Overview

HandsMen Threads is a modern fashion brand aiming to enhance customer experiences and operational efficiency through Salesforce. This project focuses on building a scalable and efficient data model that ensures the smooth handling of customer, order, and inventory data across departments.

To maintain business-critical accuracy, the system enforces data integrity directly through the user interface (UI). This ensures reliable insights, reduces manual errors, and supports smarter decision-making across the company.

## 🚀 Key Features & Functional Highlights

1. **📧 Automated Order Confirmations**  
   Customers receive immediate email updates upon placing orders, improving transparency and building trust.

2. **🎁 Dynamic Loyalty Status Updates**  
   Customer loyalty levels are automatically adjusted based on purchase history, promoting repeat purchases through personalized incentives.

3. **📦 Low Stock Alerts**  
   When product inventory drops below five units, real-time alerts are triggered to the warehouse team, ensuring proactive restocking.

4. **🕛 Scheduled Bulk Order Processing**  
   A nightly job runs at midnight to update inventory and financial records, streamlining bulk order workflows and maintaining accurate stock levels.

## 💼 Purpose

This Salesforce implementation empowers HandsMen Threads to operate with agility, ensuring seamless integration between sales, customer support, and warehouse functions — all while delivering a consistent, data-driven customer experience.
